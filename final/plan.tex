\chapter{Teaching plan}\label{ap:plan}

Tutorials are primarily focussed upon topics the students are having difficulty with or are particularly interested in learning more about. On a week-by-week basis, I plan the contents of tutorials around problem sets. I always leave time for students to raise topics and to discuss what they have been covering in lectures. Around these activities, I must schedule the teaching of key skills (CV preparation, giving a presentation, writing an essay and revision). Below I give my macroscale plan for tutorials that includes when significant elements of the key-skills course components are covered, but not the smaller details of which problems or lectures would be covered in each session, or brief discussions of progress or straightforward questions.

The tutorial plan for the 2013/2014 academic year is shown in \tabref{2013-14}, and the plan for 2014/2015 is shown in \tabref{2014-15}. The most significant difference between the two is the introduction of a practice essay. A draft plan for 2015/2016 is shown in \tabref{2015-16}, the most significant change here being the inclusion of a more significant introduction to tutorials and communication skills in the first tutorial. These plans list the schedule for twenty tutorials across the autumn and spring terms plus one revision tutorial in the summer term. One of the weekly tutorial slots in the autumn term is replaced by a careers tutorial; this is delivered by a member of the careers service and is subject to their time-constraints. In addition to the regular tutorials, there are one-on-one meetings at the start of the year, which serve as an introduction, and half-way through the year, which are progress review tutorials (PRTs). I use the PRTs to not only give feedback on the students' performances, but also to ask for feedback on mine. Also included in the plans are the dates of the essay deadline (both the final deadline and the early deadline I set in order to prevent last-minute panic) and the time that I make available as office hours should any students wish to talk about their essay. These plans are discussed in \chapref{essay}.

\caption{Tutorial teaching plan for the academic year 2013/2014. Teaching activities are listed by term, week number and date. Included are twenty regular tutorials, one revision tutorial and a careers tutorial (delivered by the careers service). In addition to these, is the one-on-one (1-on-1) meeting at the start of the year, which serves to introduce student and tutor, and the progress review tutorial (PRT) at the start of the second term. The dates of the essay deadlines and the office hours for discussion of essay writing are also included. The penultimate column lists task or pieces of work that the student is expected to complete and bring along. The final column lists topics pertaining to key skills that are discussed in detail; this does not include brief checks of progress, quick questions from students, etc.}\label{tab:2013-14}

\caption{Draft tutorial teaching plan for the academic year 2015/2016. The table contents are similar to those of \tabref{2013-14}. Since timetables have not been fixed and I do not know who I will be tutoring, it is not possible to provide data. A careers tutorial will need to be included in the autumn term schedule, hence week numbers cannot be fixed. The insertion of the careers tutorial will mean that the schedule will need to be adapted; potentially this can help spread the workload more evenly through the term. The most significant change compared to \tabref{2014-15} is the addition of an introduction to tutorials at the start of the year, that will also incorporate the setting of the formative essay and the presentation. I have also allowed two weeks for the completion of the formative essay.}\label{tab:2015-16}
