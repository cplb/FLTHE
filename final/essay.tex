\chapter{Teaching essay writing}\label{ch:essay}

In this chapter we shall examine in detail an my teaching of essay writing. SGTs have been my primary experience of teaching (\secref{teach-n-learn}) and are an important component of an undergraduate physics course (\secref{small}) making them the natural subject for me to study my teaching. There are many aspects of tutorials, too many to examine in detail. The teaching of communication skills is one aspect that differs between my previous teaching in Cambridge and my current teaching in Birmingham. I have therefore selected essay writing, one component of this, as a subject. Conclusions drawn from how I teach essay writing should transfer to the teaching of other parts of the the curriculum in tutorials.

We begin with a description of essay writing within the second-year course in \secref{problem}. Then we look at how I teaching essay writing in \secref{essay-teach}. I have identified two areas where I could potentially improve my teaching of essay writing: setting a formative, practice essay and providing written advice that can be used as reference. These are described in sections \ref{sec:formative} and \ref{sec:blog} respectively. The outcomes of my teaching are evaluated in \chapref{conc}.

\section{The second-year essay}\label{sec:problem}

Second-year Physics students at the University of Birmingham have to write an essay as part of their (compulsory) Physics \& Communication Skills 2 module. The essay constitutes $10\%$ of the marks for the module, which in turn makes up $10$ out of $120$ credits for the year. This means the essay is worth just under $1\%$ of the students' second-year grade. Students will have previously written an essay in their first year as part of their skills training; this makes up $15\%$ of a $10$ credit module and shares an identical mark scheme to the second-year essay. The essay assessment emphasises writing proficiency over scientific content, the mark scheme is described in \tabref{mark-scheme}.\footnote{Taken from the Year 2 Physics and Communication Skills handbook \url{https://intranet.birmingham.ac.uk/eps/documents/staff/physics/students/handbook/handbook-y2-comms.pdf}.}

The emphasis is on good scientific writing ($60\%$ of the marks) rather than on scientific content ($30\%$). Being outside of the word limits results in a loss of $10\%$ from the mark, and late submission results in a penalty of $10\%$ per day. Students who score below $60\%$ have to resubmit a revised version within two weeks; failure to do so results in a score of zero. Resubmitted essays are capped at a maximum mark of $60$.}\label{tab:mark-scheme}
\end{table}

The essay can be on any physics-related topic (except those used for the first-year essay and their oral presentation). The students must research this themselves. The word limit is $2000 \pm 200$. 

In addition to the essay, students have others piece of assessed, extended scientific writing associated with their projects (another $10$ credit module). They must write a preliminary report of $2$--$4$ sides of A4 by the third week of the Spring Term (see \apref{plan}). This is worth worth $10\%$ of the module and its main purpose is to ensure that students have a plan for their projects. Accordingly, written style is not too important provided that students can produce a concise and technical report. Following completion of their essay, they have to submit a write-up of their project. This report has a maximum length of $20$ sides of A4 and is worth $50\%$ of the module. Marks are awarded both for the quality of the project (judged from the report) and quality of the report itself. This project report is both longer and worth more marks than the essay, hence using the essay as a means of improving scientific writing is beneficial for the student. The essay must be submitted by the end of week 6 of the Spring Term (see \apref{plan}) and the project report by the end of week 11; this gives a short time to receive and digest feedback from the essay, making it advantageous for students to receive guidance and to think about their writing style earlier in the year.


\section{Teaching plan}\label{sec:essay-teach}

In this section we discuss my teaching of essay writing. We begin with a description of some of the key learning outcomes I have identified (\secref{essay-aims}). Then we discuss how the essay fits into the schedule for tutorials (\secref{timetable}) and some of my specific approaches to teaching (\secref{essay-mthods}). I have introduced two new aspects to my teaching this year, which are described in \secref{formative} and \secref{blog}.

\subsection{Objectives}\label{sec:essay-aims}

Scientific writing (as an essay, report or paper) has many aspects, as indicated in \tabref{mark-scheme}. Most fundamental is the ability to communicate clearly, to use English properly. It should be expected that students have a basic proficiency with written English before they start university, having studied it for an extended period of time. In practise, English levels may not be a high as is desirable, particular for international students who are not native speakers and understandably find it more difficult. Support for improving written English is available from the Academic Skills Centre,\footnote{The Academic Skills Centre is run by the University of Birmingham Library Services \url{https://intranet.birmingham.ac.uk/as/libraryservices/library/skills/asc/index.aspx}} and English-language support for international students is available from the English for International Students Unit.\footnote{The English for International Students Unit is part of the University of Birmingham's Academic Services \url{https://intranet.birmingham.ac.uk/as/eisu/insessional/index.aspx}} In my tutorials I will focus on aspects of academic, scientific writing that are different from less formal writing and so are less familiar.

I will split the differences between scientific writing and more general written English in to three classes:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Specialisations---Modifications of familiar concepts to match the expectations of formal scientific writing, e.g.\ the structure of an an introduction, main body and conclusion.
\item Conventions---Rules for particular aspects of the writing that may be simple to follow, but could be overlooked if not explained, e.g.\ the proper typesetting of mathematics.
\item Threshold concepts---The most challenging ideas to grasp as they require a transformation of how the work is viewed, e.g.\ the need for referencing.
\end{enumerate}
The first is easiest to teach and the third is most difficult, although all three are important and require attention. Specialisations include adopting an appropriate structure, using a formal tone and scientific language (aspects of the Structure, Basic writing style and Clarity mark scheme categories). Many of these concepts may be familiar and students may just need to extend their current practices. Conventions are often arbitrary and may not be immediately apparent to the uninitiated, such as the distinction between italic and roman (upright) typesetting of terms in equations, how to label graph axes, or how to format entries in a bibliography. These primarily fall under the heading of Presentation in the mark scheme; following them makes the writing more recognisable as a piece of scientific text. Once students are aware of the conventions, following the rules is not challenging, but it may difficult to convince the students that this is worth the effort. Threshold concepts are the ideas that have the largest impact on the development of the students and are discussed further in \apref{threshold}. For my students, I have found three threshold concepts:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Not restricting themselves to prose---Using equations, diagrams or graphs, tables or even bullet points to communicate information (depending upon the audience).
\item Referencing \citep{Warner2011}---Including in-text citations to appropriate sources in the relevant places to support and supplement their arguments.
\item Being quantitative---Using numbers (either empirical or theoretical) to make specific quantitative statements, either to replace potentially subjective qualitative statements or to provide unambiguous evidence for a statement, e.g. saying ``the surface of the Sun is $6000~\mathrm{K}$'' rather than ``the surface of the Sun is hot'' as both a cup of tea and the centre of the Sun could equally be claimed to be hot, yet both have temperatures that are orders of magnitude different.\footnote{The lack of quantitative statements could be viewed as the surface manifestation of a deeper problem of failing to understand that a reader who wants to engage with the material, to evaluate the validity of the arguments or to perform their own calculations, would require this information.}
\end{enumerate}
Identifying means to make learning these concepts easier could potentially have a significant impact on the quality of students' written work.

\subsection{Scheduling}\label{sec:timetable}

Given infinite time, all of the previous subsection's could be perfectly taught. However, tutorials are finite and must cover more than writing skills (\secref{small}). In \apref{plan} there is an outline for tutorials through the year. Students must not be over-burdened as this is detrimental to their learning \citep[chapter 8]{Ramsden1992}, and a perceived heavy workload is correlated with adoption of a surface-learning approach\citep[and references therein]{Kember1998}.\footnote{\citet{Kember1998} find the workload is perceived as higher by students learning in a second language, which makes it especially important not to schedule too much for international students.}

In the Autumn term, students must prepare oral presentations (also worth $10\%$ of the Physics \& Communication Skills 2 module), which must be delivered by the end of the term. This leaves little time for written communication skills. However, it is possible to link the two types of communication skills together: there is significant overlap between the two (thinking of audience, planning structure, presenting technical content, conducting research, etc.). Thus, preparing and delivering the presentation can be used as instruction for the essay provided that the connections are made apparent. This integration has the additional benefit of ensuring that the presentation is not viewed as an isolated task, encouraging students to use feedback from this experience \citep{Housell2003}.

Following completion of the presentations, students have the Christmas vacation and the first half of the Spring term for their essays. The vacation provides a good opportunity to pick a topic and begin research, and writing skills can be discussed when they return. The Spring tutorials will be where most of the teaching is done.

While the presentation precludes spending time of writing skills for much of the Autumn term, there remains some freedom at the start of the year. In the first few weeks, students' workloads are lower, since problem sets have yet to be issued, and consequently there is less to be discussed during tutorials. Students do have to provide an updated CV by the third tutorial of term, but this is a small task that can be accomplished quickly.\footnote{The students write a CV in first year, so it only requires a few modifications to bring it up to date. Discussing their CV in the first one-on-one meeting is a useful way to get to know the students and it leads naturally onto their academic background, how they did last year, and where they hope to be in the future.} This time at the start of the year could be potentially filled with material relating to the essay.

\subsection{Methods and activities}\label{sec:essay-methods}

Specialisations arose naturally in discussions. Being familiar with the topics, students knew that these were things to aspect about and potentially develop further. Proximal zone. I could cover any elements they had not thought of.
