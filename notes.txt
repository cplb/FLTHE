Chapter 2: The process of experimental learning (20--38)

Immediate personal experience is the focal point for learning, giving life, texture, and subjective personal meaning to abstract concepts and at the same time providing a concrete, publicly shared reference point for testing the implications and validity of ideas created during the learning process.

Learning is best conceived as a process, not in terms of outcomes.

Learning is the process whereby knowledge is created through the transformation of experience.

Chapter 7: Learning and development in higher education (161--208)

Disciplines, as we have seen, show sociocultural variation---differences in faculty and student demographics, personality, and aptitudes, as well as differences in values and group norms. For students, education in an academic field is a continuing process of selection and socialization to the pivotal norms of the field governing criteria for truth and how it is to be achieved, communicated, and used, and secondarily, to peripheral norms governing personal styles, attitudes, and social relationships. Over time, these selection and socialization pressures combine to produce an increasingly impermeable and homogeneous disciplinary culture and correspondingly specialized student orientations to learning.

Many students, for example, resist required courses designed to broaden their interests. One way to deal with this problem is for teacher and student to share explicitly their respective theories of learning. From this discussion, the student can gain insight into why the subject matter is taught as it is and what adjustments he need make in his approach to learning this subject.

Learning becomes a skill that can be improved and coached.


Chapter 8: Lifelong learning and integrative development (208--230)

For many, choices made earlier have led down pathways no longer rewarding, and some kind of change is needed. At this point, many finally face up to the fact that they will never realize their youthful dreams and that new, more realistic goals must be found if life is to have purpose. Others, even if successful in their earlier pursuits, discover that they have purchased success in career at the expense of other responsibilities (such as to spouse and children) or other kinds of human fulfilment. Continued accentuation of an overspecialized version of oneself eventually becomes stultifying---one begins to feel stuck, static, in a rut.




***Jaques & Salmon***

Introduction (1--4)

Our approach to learning is based [sic] the following assumptions:
 - We learn best when we are personally and actively involved in the learning experience.
 - Knowledge of any kind has more significance when we learn it through our own initiative, insight and discovery.
 - Learning is best when we are committed to aims that we have been involved in setting, when our participation with others is valued and when there is a supporting framework in which to learn.


Chapter 1: Theory and practice in group dynamics (5--21)

Many regard six as a critical number for groups in all sorts of situations. With six or less [sic], the degree of intimacy, whether physical or virtual, offered by close proximity can somehow make it difficult for group members to register their feelings about the group. Leadership tends to be fluid and interchangeable. As the group size increases, the climate of the group changes.

Under the authoritative mode the tutor can be:
1 Directing
  Raising an issue for discussion, re-routing the discussion.
  Suggesting further work to be done.
2 Informing
  Summarising.
  Interrelating.
  Giving knowledge and information.
3 Confronting
  Challenging by direct question.
  Disagreeing with /correcting/critically evaluating student statement.

Under the facilitative mode the tutor can be:
4 Releasing tension
  Arousing laughter.
  Allowing students to discharge unpleasant emotions such as embarrassment, irritation, confusion and sometimes even anger.
5 Eliciting
  Drawing out student opinions/knowledge/problem-solving ability.
  Facilitating student interaction.
  Enabling students to learn and develop by self-discovery and personal insight.
6 Supporting
  Approving/reinforcing/agreeing with/affirming the value of student contributions.


Chapter 2: Studies of group behaviour (22--49)

Cohesiveness is a measure of the attraction of the group to its members (and resistance to leaving it), in the sense of team spirit, and the willingness of its members to coordinate their efforts. Compared with members of a low-cohesive group, those in a high-cohesive group will, therefore, be keen to attend meetings, be satisfied with the group, use 'we' rather than 'I' in discussions, be cooperative and friendly with each other, and be more effective in achieving the aims they set for themselves. The low-cohesive group will be marked by absenteeism, the growth of cliques and factions, and a sense of frustration at the lack of attainment.

Luker (1987) in Brown and Atkins (1999) lists a number of student and tutor likes and dislikes on the subject of small group teaching, a selection of which are made here. [Luker, P. Some cases of small group teaching, unpublished thesis, University of Nottingham]


Chapter 3: Approaches to learning (50--67)

The inference that online discussion may be of special value for less assertive students in borne out by Rainsbury and Malcolm (2003) who found that two groups of students who often lacked confidence in face-to-face situations -- mature students and those of non-English backgrounds -- found it easier to express an opinion on asynchronous discussion boards, and inferred that such online discussion could be used to develop their groupwork skills.

Chapter 6: Activities for groups (104--158)

The tutorial, whether face-to-face or online, is concerned with the development of the student's powers of thought.

Tutorials serve two main functions:
 - As a regular ground for the checking of student progress, locating misunderstandings in lectures and an opportunity to give special scrutiny to a piece of student's work.
 - As the setting for the pastoral role for the tutor.


Chapter 10: Case studies of group teaching and learning (253--272)

>>Passports for seminars: Oxford Brookes School of Business increased increased student participation in seminar series by requiring students to prepare a note card on the required reading before they could be admitted. (card was scrutinies by lecturer before being returned during the examination. Trend of increasingly-decreasing numbers was reversed: attendance rapidly shot up to 90--100 per cent, the discussion was livelier and more informed, and the students were more enthusiastic.




***Brown & Atkins***

Chapter 2. Studies of lecturing (7--18)

The verbal messages may consist of definitions, descriptions, examples, explanations, or comments. The 'extra-verbal' component is the lecturer's vocal qualities, hesitations, stumbles, errors, and use of pauses and silence. The 'non-verbal' component consists of his or her gestures, facial expressions, and body movements. Audio-visual messages are presented on blackboards, transparencies, slides, and audio-visual extracts.

Attention fluctuates throughout a one-hour lecture. After twenty minutes there is a marked decline in attention followed by a peak of attention just before the lecture ends. This declines in attention is less likely to occur if the lecture includes some short activities for students such as brief small group discussions or simple problem-solving. Any change of activity is, in fact, likely to renew attention.

Messages that are received by the students are filtered and stored temporarily in the short-term memory. They are forgotten after about thirty seconds if they cannot be kept in mind or noted, or if they cannot be transferred to the long-term memory. They are forgotten after about thirty seconds if they cannot be kept in mind or noted, or if they cannot be transferred to the long-term memory.

The long-term memory most readily receives messages which are closely related to the network of concepts and facts which are already stored in the long-term memory and have been called up. For links can then be made between the new and old. Sometimes this processing of new information in the light of the old will profoundly affect the pre-existing networks and information and they will be 'returned' to long-term store in a different or modified form. A lecture can, therefore, radically change your perception of a topic or issue. The long-term memory will also store new messages which are only loosely associated with existing facts and ideas. But facts and concepts that are incomprehensible are not likely to be stored.


Chapter 4: Effective small group teaching (50--90)

Their findings also suggest that, in general, heterogeneous groups are more effective at group decision-making than individuals of the same personalities or abilities. [Citing social psychology studies from various sources]

Foster (1981) in a study of tutorials found tutor talk to be as high as 86 per cent and student--student interaction as low as 8 per cent. Lecturers used students' ideas less than 2 per cent of the time. Luker (1987) in a study of small group teaching in a British university found that the proportion of time spent on lecturing in small groups varied from 7 to 70 per cent and the proportion of time devoted to asking questions varied from 1 to 28 per cent. The mean time spent by tutors talking was 64 per cent. Physics, production engineering, and education had the student groups who made most contributions. [Luker, P.A. (1987) 'Some case studies of small group teaching', unpublished PhD, University of Nottingham]



***Ramsden***

Preface (ix--x)

There are no right answers: there are only methods that may work better or worse for each individual teacher, each department, and each group of students.


Chapter 2: Ways of understanding teaching (12--16)

A good way of starting to learn more about any subject is to review what you already know about it.


Chapter 3: What students learn (17--37)

In summary, the research indicates that, at least for a short period, students retain vast quantities of information. On the other hand, many of them soon seem to forget much of it (see, for example, Saunders, 1980), and they appear not to make good use of what they do remember. They experience many superficial changes---acquiring the jargon of disciplines, for example---but they still tend to operate with naïve and erroneous conceptions. Moreover, many students are unaware of what they do not know: they have not developed self-critical awareness in their subjects.

Even simple algebraic thinking seems to prove problematic for many higher education students. As soon as they are set free from the straightforward manipulation of symbols, and are forced to consider the meaning underlying them as well, many appear to flounder.


Chapter 4: Approaches to learning (38--61)

students obliged to use a surface approach to a task, or to an entire course, describe their feelings of resentment, depression, and anxiety. In contrast, deep approaches are almost universally associated with a sense of involvement, challenge, and achievement, together with feelings of personal fulfilment and pleasure.

Students who are taking a deep approach find the material more interesting and easier to understand, and are therefore more likely to spend ‘time on task’. But studying using a surface approach is a tedious and unrewarding activity: persisting with this approach leads to procrastination and delay. Surface approaches thus mean that students spend less and less time in private study, and consequently are more likely to fail their exams.

When students appear to be ‘unable to study’ we should examine their approaches to learning before blaming them for being idle and unmotivated, particularly in view of the effect of our teaching on their approaches

Many assessment methods do not test understanding, even though we may believe that they do. Students may succeed in an examination or a degree course despite using a surface approach;


Chapter 5: Learning from the student's approach (62--85)

In each of these interventions, the effects on student learning were the opposite of those that were intended by the designers, precisely because the students saw things differently.

But deep approaches are fragile things; while we can create favourable conditions for them, students’ previous experiences and other unmeasured factors may mean that they remain unexercised. This is a warning worth heeding, both in evaluating our own teaching and when it comes to measuring the effectiveness of other people’s. No one can ever be certain that teaching will cause students to learn. In the last analysis, excellence in teaching cannot guarantee that students will understand.

>>Table 5.1 Characteristics of the context of learning associated with deep and surface approaches


Chapter 6: The nature of good teaching in higher education (86--108)

Now I take it for granted throughout this book that there cannot be one ‘best’ way of teaching. Like studying, it is too complicated and personal a business for a single strategy to be right for everybody and every discipline. So far so good. It is folly, however, to carry this truism beyond its proper territory and to suggest that there are no better or worse ways of teaching, no general attributes that distinguish good teaching from bad.

Moreover, when students are asked to identify the important characteristics of a good lecturer, they identify the same ones that lecturers themselves do: organisation, stimulation of interest, understandable explanations, empathy with students’ needs, feedback on work, clear goals, encouraging independent thought. Down at the bottom of the list are the lecturer’s personality and sense of humour.

>>SIX KEY PRINCIPLES OF EFFECTIVE TEACHING IN HIGHER EDUCATION
Principle 1: Interest and explanation
Principle 2: Concern and respect for students and student learning
Principle 3: Appropriate assessment and feedback
Principle 4: Clear goals and intellectual challenge
Principle 5: Independence, control, and active engagement
Principle 6: Learning from students

It provides relevant learning tasks at the right level for students’ current understanding; it recognises that each student will learn best in his or her own way; it avoids creating over-dependence. It helps students to understand the essence of scholarship and investigation in their subjects by providing an opportunity for them to practise the art of enquiry.


Chapter 7: Theories of teaching in higher education (109--119)

Learning is applying and modifying one’s own ideas; it is something the student does, rather than something that is done to the student.

Improving teaching is an integral part of theory 3, precisely because it expresses a notion of teaching as a speculative and reflexive activity. Using theory 3 means listening to students and listening to other teachers in an effort to teach better.

Thus, theory 1 assumes that content knowledge and fluent presentation are enough for good teaching. Theory 2 complements this picture with additional skills focused principally on student activity and the acquisition of extra teaching techniques. Theory 3 presupposes all these abilities and extends the understanding of teaching so that it becomes embedded in the nature of subject knowledge and the nature of how it is learned.

Importantly, the quality of a teacher’s reflections on how his or her teaching is working affect the theories used and in turn the future actions taken.


Chapter 8: The goals and structure of a course (123--149)

Much the easiest mistake to make in deciding upon content and aims is to include too much content. We should rather strive to include less, but to ensure that students learn that smaller part properly.


Chapter 9: Teaching strategies for effective learning (150--180)

The first of these is to discourage students from using surface approaches: this implies avoiding excessive workloads, busywork, and unnecessary time pressures; shunning assessment practices that require recall or rehearsal of trivial detail; abandoning all attempts to devalue students’ tentative steps towards understanding; avoiding cynical comments (explicit or implicit) about the subject matter and students’ grasp of it.

*The teacher gives a lecture rather than conducting a dialogue.
*The teacher talks too much.
*Students cannot be encouraged to talk except with difficulty; they will not talk to each other, but will only respond to questions from the tutor.
*Students do not prepare for the sessions.
*One student dominates the discussion, or blocks it.
*The students want to be given the solutions to problems rather than discussing them.

Few discussions of media, and few books about teaching in higher education, say much about the medium through which many students will continue to learn for the foreseeable future---the book. [...] Two of the most worrying problems---the quality of the reading materials themselves and their selection---are usually left untouched.


Chapter 10: Assessing for understanding (181--213)

Seeing assessment as an external imposition to be negotiated in order to earn a grade, rather than a way of learning and of demonstrating understanding, is an optimal recipe for surface approaches.

Entwistle’s investigation of first year engineering students in Scottish higher education (Entwistle et al., 1989; see also chapter 8) showed that an important contributory cause of student failure was an almost complete absence of feedback on progress during the first term of their studies. Some students only realised they were in danger of failure after receiving the results of the first end-of-term examinations; even then, they were usually not given information that would enable them to improve.

The prudent use of model answers, taken either from students’ work or specially written by the lecturer, is an excellent form of feedback.

FOURTEEN RULES FOR BETTER ASSESSMENT IN HIGHER EDUCATION
1. Link assessment to learning: focus first on learning, second on encouraging effort, and third on grading; assess during the experience of learning as well as at the end of it; set tasks that mimic realistic problems whenever possible; reward integration and application.
2. Never assess without giving comments to students about how they might improve.
3. Learn from your students’ mistakes. Use assessment to discover their misunderstandings, then modify teaching to address them.
4. Deploy a variety of assessment methods.
5. Try to get students participating in the assessment process, through:
* discussions of appropriate methods and how the methods relate to the course goals
* joint staff-student design of assessment questions and negotiation of criteria for success and failure
* self and peer assessment activities 
* offering students responsible choice among different methods.
6. Give lucid and frequent messages, both in the assessment questions you set and in your course goals, that memorisation, reproduction, and imitation will be penalised and that success in your courses will only be achieved through decisive demonstrations of understanding.
7. Think about the relation between reporting and feedback; justify on educational grounds either the separation or the combination of the diagnostic and summative functions of a particular test, rather than blindly applying an algorithm such as ‘No assessment for feedback should count for a mark’ or ‘Every assessment should count or students won’t bother with it.’
8. Use multiple-choice and other ‘objective’ tests very cautiously, preferably in combination with other methods. When numbers of students and time permit alternative techniques (see 6 above), use these.
9. In subjects involving quantitative manipulations, always include questions requiring explanations in prose (such as ‘What does it mean in this case to say that the standard deviation is 1.8?’) as well as numerical examples.
10. Focus on validity (is what you are measuring important?) before reliability (is your test consistent?). Try to avoid the temptation to test trifling aspects because they are easier to measure than important ones.
11. Do everything in your power to lessen the anxiety raised by assessments.
12. ‘Examinations are formidable even to the best prepared, for the greatest fool may ask more than the wisest man can answer’ (Colton). Never set an assignment or examination question you are not ready to answer yourself. Practise the habit of writing model answers to your questions and using them to help students appreciate what you want.
13.  Reduce the between-student competitive aspects of assessment while simultaneously providing inducements to succeed against a standard (through using assessments of group products and deriving standards from several cohorts of students, for example).
14. Be suspicious of the objectivity and accuracy of all measures of student ability and conscious that human judgement is the most important element in every indicator of achievement.


Chapter 11. Evaluating the quality of higher education (217--269)

The theory of teaching and learning underlying performance appraisal of teaching is nowhere better represented than in the extraordinary belief it professes in the powers of student rating questionnaires. The strength of this entirely misplaced belief vies for educational naïvety with the conception of assessment as a process of discovering the absolute truth about a student’s ability through a three-hour examination at the end of a programme of study.



***Biggs in Schmeck***

[8. Approaches to Learning and to essay Writing (185--228)]

1. Writing externalizes thought, thereby allowing the thinker--writer the opportunity of reconsidering, clarifying, or revising what has been proposed.
2. The fact that writing is disembedded from an immediate context that is rich in nonverbal cues means that the writer, unlike the speaker who may rely on paralinguistic supports, needs to be particularly clear and explicit.
3. Writing usually requires more activity than simply "thinking" about the topic, and so the writer tends to be more actively involved in the process of creating meaning.
4. Proper attention to the audience will force the writer to consider different perspectives on the message content from that of the writer's own.

1. Intentional, including affective and aspirational aspects prior to writing.
2. Parawriting activities, including planning and knowledge updating.
3. Writing activities, including composing and transcribing, reviewing, and revising.

>>Many different approaches to planning, writing and reviewing mirroring many different levels of learning, also many different compositions and genres.
